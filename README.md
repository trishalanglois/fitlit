# FitLit -- Being Fit is Lit

## Description

FitLit is a project that simulates an activity tracker, allowing a given user to see their health statistics.  Statistics include steps taken, water consumed, quality and quantity of sleep, and stairs climbed.  To make it even more dynamic, the user can see other users' stats, both the friends that are linked to their profile and averages of all users in the database.

Part of this project was also designing a UI/UX comp.  We used Canva to make a mock-up and used that for wireframming and writing/implementing our CSS.

Technically, this project incorporated designing the architecture of the project, which included multiple classes to handle various small databases.  Code implementation focused on using information from various databases in the same classes and how those can talk to each other.

## Testing

Testing was a key component in this project.  Tests were written for all functions associated with classes and data manipulation or aggregation.
